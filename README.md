# 🦠 COVID-19 Patient Outcomes Analysis

📊 This project explores a real-world COVID-19 dataset to understand **patient outcomes, risk factors, and hospitalization trends**.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

* Understand **patient demographics** (age, gender)
* Explore **hospitalization & ICU trends**
* Analyze **comorbidities (medical conditions)** and their impact on outcomes
* Compare **pregnancy & COVID-19 outcomes**
* Study **lifestyle factors (tobacco use)** and severity
* Evaluate **confirmed vs suspected COVID cases**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** 🐍
* **Pandas** → Data cleaning & analysis
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive exploration

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses

* **Gender & Age Analysis**

  * Which age groups are most affected?
  * Do men and women show different outcomes?

* **Patient Outcomes**

  * Recovery vs death rates
  * Impact of age on recovery

* **Comorbidities**

  * Most common conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity)
  * Which conditions are strongly linked to death?

* **Hospitalization & ICU**

  * ICU admissions and intubation rates
  * Factors (age, conditions) increasing ICU needs

* **Pregnancy & COVID-19**

  * Outcomes for pregnant vs non-pregnant women
  * ICU and death rate differences

* **Lifestyle Factors**

  * Did tobacco use increase severity?
  * ICU & death rate comparison

* **Case Classification**

  * Confirmed vs suspected cases
  * Outcomes across case types

---

## 📊 Visualizations

* Age group vs outcome bar charts
* Gender distribution plots
* Comorbidity frequency charts
* ICU admission heatmaps
* Pregnancy vs COVID-19 outcomes bar graph

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add **machine learning models** (predict severity from features)
* Create **interactive dashboards** using **Plotly / Dash / Streamlit**
* Explore **time-series trends** (cases & deaths over time)
* Perform **geospatial analysis** (cases by region with maps)
* Improve visualizations with **advanced charts**
